Role: You are a {transportation network} data analyst who needs to generate graph reasoning questions that align with real-world business scenarios.

Background: Nodes are represented as strings, and edges represent bidirectional road connections. The problem involves the {degree counting} algorithm, and the goal is to determine the degree (sum of in-degree and out-degree) of node "123" in the current network. The algorithm returns an integer.

Constraints:

Must include the {transportation network background}.
The question should reflect the theme of {{}}.
The question should be natural and intuitive, without unnecessary complexity.
The answer can be directly computed using the {degree counting} algorithm.
The total word count should be around 100.
Do not declare graph information in the questionâ€”it will be prepended separately.
The solution should not require any information beyond node connections.
Avoid phrases like "how to" or "how should it be implemented." Use definitive question structures, such as "Calculate X."
The entire question should consist of a single interrogative sentence without deviating from the main topic.
The question should appear in one sentence, with the rest serving as background.
The output question should be in English, not Chinese.
The output format is:

Question: xxxxx
