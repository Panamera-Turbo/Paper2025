I need you to generate a negative sample for this question. The format should remain consistent with the original format of "Thought" and "API_Name," but ensure that the reasoning in the response is incorrect. You can choose these tool whatever you prefer 'shortest_path' 'degree_graphCount' 'number_of_edges_graphCount' 'is_path_graphExistance'  'is_node_graphExistance' 'is_edge_graphExistance'
Here's what I need:

Example:
Question: How does the Jaccard coefficient measure the similarity of 882050 and 369518?
Right Answer:
Thought: To measure the similarity between two sets, I will use the Jaccard coefficient Tool. The Jaccard coefficient is out of tool set, so the API_Name should be None.
Tool_name: None

Wrong Answer:
Thought: To find the Jaccard coefficient for nodes 882050 and 369518, I will use the intersection and union of the neighbors of these two nodes and then calculate the ratio of the intersection to the union.
Tool_name: degree_graphCount

Note: Your output should only include Thought and Tool_name. Do not include anything else.
