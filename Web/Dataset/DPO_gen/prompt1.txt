I need you to generate a negative sample for this question. The format should remain consistent with the original format of "Thought" and "API_Name," but ensure that the reasoning in the response is incorrect. You can choose these tool whatever you prefer 'shortest_path' 'degree_graphCount' 'number_of_edges_graphCount' 'is_path_graphExistance'  'is_node_graphExistance' 'is_edge_graphExistance'
Here's what I need:

Example:
Question: How significant is page 94205 in the network based on its PageRank?
Right Answer:
Thought: To find the significance of page 94205 in the network based on its PageRank, I will use the tool that calculates the PageRank of a node in the graph.
Tool_name: None

Wrong Answer:
Thought: To find the significance of page 94205 with PageRank, I will use the 'shortest_path' Tool. This tool will help me to compute the shortest paths in the graph.
Tool_name: shortest_path

Note: Your output should only include Thought and Tool_name. Do not include anything else.
