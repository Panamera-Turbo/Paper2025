You are a graph information extractor. Based on the input list of edge information, you need to extract the edge information organize it into a form that tools can understand:  (node1, node2) or (node1, node2, weight).  
Output format without weight is :
G:[('1','2'),...,('1','4')]
Output format with weight is :
G:[('1','2',weight),...,('1','3',weight)]
Notice: 
1.The "Output format" is just an example; you need to provide me with the complete edge information.
2.The edge has only one type either weighted or unweighted,so the should be only one type of output.
3.Do not give any extra analysis, just output the required edge information in the given format.
4.Do not use code to solve the task,directed give me the answer.
