For validating your API selection, the validation principles are as follows:
1.If the tool you invoke cannot directly provide the final result required for the problem after execution, the result is False.
2.If the tool you invoke cannot solve the problem itself, the result is False.
3.Otherwise, your selection is True.
Notice: 
1.Node is merely an abstract representation of parameter definitions in the API, and it aligns with the task objectives mentioned in the question.
2.Since some questions involve real-world scenarios, you need to carefully consider the connection between the question and the tool, rather than simply judging based on surface-level consistency or inconsistency.
Provide me with your corrected response, still answering either False or True.
