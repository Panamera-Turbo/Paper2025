First, I need to understand the user's specific requirements. The user is a data analyst in the field of web topology networks, and the problem needs to involve interdisciplinary research prediction themes, so I need to incorporate this background.\n\nThe user has given quite a few constraints, such as the necessity of including a web topology network context, that the question should be natural and intuitive without being convoluted. Additionally, it should not use complex structures, containing only one question, and there is no need to declare graph information in the question since the user will handle that part themselves. The answer should be directly obtainable using the Reference_Match algorithm without needing any additional information.\n\nNext, I need to determine how to weave in the interdisciplinary research prediction aspect. It might be useful to set a scene, for example, predicting which interdisciplinary fields may become hotspots, thus requiring an analysis of the common citation situation across different fields. The question should then focus on calculating the common citation count between two nodes, which in this context are web pages identified by numbers 0302 and 0714.\n\nI need to ensure the question sounds natural, such as using “calculate the common citation count of these two review pages” instead of a clumsy expression. Meanwhile, the interdisciplinary theme may require mentioning multiple fields, like bioinformatics, computational sociology, and quantum chemistry, to enhance its realism.\n\nI also need to pay attention to the word count.",
