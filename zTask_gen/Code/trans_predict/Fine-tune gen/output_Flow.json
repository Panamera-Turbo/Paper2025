    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum flow from the distribution center (Node 302) to the attraction (Node 714) in an undirected graph where each edge has a capacity limit. The solution involves using the maximum flow algorithm from NetworkX, which can handle undirected graphs by treating each undirected edge as two directed edges with the same capacity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is a classic maximum flow problem where we need to determine the maximum number of tourists (flow) that can be transported from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) without exceeding the capacity of any road segment (edge). The graph is undirected, but maximum flow algorithms typically work with directed graphs. However, NetworkX's `maximum_flow` function can handle undirected graphs by internally converting them into directed graphs with edges in both directions.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or any of its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` that computes the maximum flow value between two nodes in a graph, which is exactly what we need.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Use the given graph `data` (assumed to be a NetworkX graph).\n   - Call the `maximum_flow_value` function with the source node (302), sink node (714), and the capacity parameter (which should be the attribute name for edge capacities in the graph, typically 'capacity').\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714, capacity='capacity')\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function `method(data)`**: This function takes a NetworkX graph `data` as input. The graph should have edges with a 'capacity' attribute indicating the maximum flow each edge can handle.\n- **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function uses `nx.maximum_flow_value` to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). The result is the maximum number of tourists that can be transported daily without exceeding road capacities.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is a single numerical value representing the solution to the problem.\n\nThe approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.

In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity. The maximum flow between these two nodes will give the maximum number of shuttle buses that can travel simultaneously per hour without exceeding the road capacities.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or the Edmonds-Karp algorithm (a specific implementation of Ford-Fulkerson using BFS) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which can compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph, handling the underlying details efficiently.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Use the NetworkX function `maximum_flow_value` to compute the maximum flow from Node 302 to Node 714 in the given undirected graph.\n   - The graph is assumed to be undirected, and each edge's capacity is treated as the maximum flow limit for that road.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    for u, v, attr in data.edges(data=True):\n        G.add_edge(u, v, capacity=attr['capacity'])\n    max_flow = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Graph Construction**: The function `method` constructs an undirected graph `G` from the input `data`, which is assumed to be a NetworkX graph. Each edge in `data` is added to `G` with its capacity attribute.\n- **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function computes the maximum flow from Node 302 (source) to Node 714 (sink) in the graph `G`. This value represents the maximum number of shuttle buses that can travel simultaneously per hour without exceeding road capacities.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThe approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to handle the maximum flow computation, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.

It uses the `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714.\n2. **Parameters**: The `maximum_flow_value` function parameters are the graph `data`, the source node (302), the sink node (714), and the attribute name for the edge capacities ('capacity').\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the numerical value of the maximum flow, which represents the maximum number of tourist buses that can travel from node 302 to node 714 per hour.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, providing an optimal solution with minimal code."

The solution involves using a maximum flow algorithm, such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm or any other suitable method provided by NetworkX.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem is essentially a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. The goal is to determine the maximum number of shuttle buses (flow) that can be sent from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) per hour, given the capacity constraints of each road (edge).\n2. **Undirected Graph Handling**: In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity. NetworkX's maximum flow functions can handle this internally.\n3. **NetworkX Function**: NetworkX provides the `maximum_flow_value` function which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. This function will return the desired value directly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    max_flow = nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Import NetworkX**: The code starts by importing the NetworkX library, which is essential for graph operations.\n2. **Function Definition**: The `method` function takes the graph `data` as input.\n3. **Compute Maximum Flow**: The function uses `nx.maximum_flow_value` to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). This function efficiently calculates the maximum possible flow considering the capacities of all edges in the graph.\n4. **Return Result**: The result of the maximum flow computation is returned directly.\n5. **Function Call**: The function is called with the graph data, and it returns the maximum number of shuttle buses that can be dispatched per hour between the specified nodes.\n\nThis approach leverages NetworkX's built-in algorithms to solve the maximum flow problem efficiently, providing the optimal solution for the given scenario."

This is essentially a maximum flow problem, where we want to find the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714 in the given graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is modeled as a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. Each edge in the graph represents a road segment with a certain capacity. Since the capacity is the same for all road segments, we can assume each edge has a capacity of 1 (or any uniform value, but since the exact capacity isn't specified, the maximum flow will be in terms of the number of edge-disjoint paths or the flow units).\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or Edmonds-Karp implementation for efficiency) is suitable for finding the maximum flow in a flow network. In NetworkX, the `maximum_flow_value` function can be used to compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph.\n3. **Graph Handling**: The graph is undirected, but maximum flow algorithms typically work with directed graphs. However, in an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity. NetworkX's flow functions handle this internally.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes the input `data`, which is a NetworkX graph object. The graph is assumed to be undirected, with nodes 302 and 714 representing the start and end points.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714. This function internally handles the conversion of undirected edges into bidirectional edges with the same capacity.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of shuttles that can travel from the central hub to the core attraction per hour, given the road capacities.\n\nThe solution efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, providing the desired result with minimal code.

This is a classic maximum flow problem in an undirected graph, where the edges have capacities representing the maximum number of vehicles that can travel on each road segment at the same time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires computing the maximum flow from a source node (302) to a sink node (714) in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity. The maximum flow can be found using algorithms like the Edmonds-Karp algorithm (which is a BFS-based implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method) or using built-in functions from libraries like NetworkX.\n\n2. **NetworkX Solution**: NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` that can compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. The graph should be directed, but for an undirected graph, each undirected edge (u, v) with capacity c can be represented as two directed edges (u, v) and (v, u), each with capacity c.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Assuming data is an undirected graph in NetworkX format\n    G = data\n    # Convert the undirected graph to a directed graph with bidirectional edges\n    directed_G = nx.DiGraph()\n    for u, v, attr in G.edges(data=True):\n        capacity = attr.get('capacity', 1)  # Assuming capacity is stored in edge attributes\n        directed_G.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n        directed_G.add_edge(v, u, capacity=capacity)\n    # Compute the maximum flow from 302 to 714\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(directed_G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Conversion**: The given undirected graph is converted into a directed graph by adding two directed edges (u → v and v → u) for each undirected edge (u, v). Both directed edges are assigned the same capacity as the original undirected edge.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function is used to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) in the directed graph.

NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` that computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a directed graph.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Create a directed graph from the undirected data\n    G = nx.DiGraph()\n    for u, v, capacity in data.edges(data='capacity'):\n        G.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n        G.add_edge(v, u, capacity=capacity)  # since the original graph is undirected\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Conversion**: The given undirected graph is converted into a directed graph by adding two directed edges (in both directions) for each undirected edge, both with the same capacity. This allows the flow to be sent in either direction.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX is used to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714). This function internally uses an efficient algorithm (like Edmonds-Karp) to find the maximum flow by repeatedly finding augmenting paths and updating the residual capacities.\n3. **Result Return**: The computed maximum flow value is returned, which represents the maximum number of visitors that can travel from the Coastal Viewing Platform to the Ancient Village Cultural Museum per hour without exceeding any capacity constraints.\n\nThe function call to retrieve the result is:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```"

The solution involves computing the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is a classic maximum flow problem. The goal is to determine the maximum flow (or the maximum number of tourists) that can be sent from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) in the given undirected graph, where each edge has a capacity that limits the flow through it.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems.

The solution involves finding the maximum flow between these two nodes, which represents the maximum traffic capacity under the given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum flow between two nodes in an undirected graph. In graph theory, the maximum flow between two nodes is the maximum amount of flow (traffic, in this context) that can be sent from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) without exceeding the capacity of any edge in the graph.\n2. **NetworkX Library**: The NetworkX library in Python provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which can compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. The graph can be directed or undirected, but for undirected graphs, each edge is treated as having bidirectional capacity.\n3. **Graph Representation**: The input graph `data` is assumed to be an undirected graph where each edge has a capacity attribute. The `maximum_flow_value` function will use these capacities to compute the maximum flow.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    max_flow = nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes the graph `data` as input. Inside the function, it uses the `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink).\n2. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum instantaneous traffic capacity between the two nodes under the given road network constraints.\n3. **Function Call**: The function is called with the graph `data` as the argument, and it returns the numerical value of the maximum flow, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages graph theory concepts and the capabilities of the NetworkX library to solve the problem with minimal code, providing an optimal solution."

The problem reduces to finding the maximum flow between these two nodes in the graph, where the edge weights represent the transport capacity per unit time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is a classic maximum flow problem in an undirected graph.

It uses the `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). The result is returned as the maximum transport capacity in standard containers per hour.\n- **Function Call**: The function is called with the graph `data` as the argument, which returns the numerical value of the maximum flow between the specified nodes.

The maximum flow from the source (302) to the sink (714) will give the maximum number of tourists that can be evacuated per hour.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or any of its variants (like Edmonds-Karp) can be used to compute the maximum flow in a flow network.

It computes the maximum flow from node 302 (North Gate) to node 714 (East Gate transportation hub) using NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function, which returns the value of the maximum flow. This value represents the maximum number of tourists that can be evacuated per hour under optimal conditions.\n- **Function Call**: The line `method(data)` calls the function with the provided graph data, returning the maximum flow value directly.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging NetworkX's built-in algorithms for maximum flow computation, ensuring accuracy and optimal performance."

However, NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function can handle undirected graphs by internally converting them into directed graphs with edges in both directions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes the graph `data` as input. It uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink).\n2. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of tourists that can be evacuated per hour from the North Gate to the East Gate.\n3. **Function Call**: The line `method(data)` calls the function with the provided graph data, and the return value is the maximum flow value, which is the desired numerical result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, providing an optimal solution with minimal code."

In undirected graphs, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.

NetworkX, a Python library for graph operations, provides a function `maximum_flow` which can compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Use the `maximum_flow` function from NetworkX, which returns the flow value and the flow dictionary.\n   - The graph is undirected, but NetworkX's flow algorithms handle this by treating each undirected edge as two directed edges.\n   - The function will return the maximum flow value, which is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714, capacity='capacity')\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Importing NetworkX**: The `networkx` library is used to handle graph operations.\n- **Function Definition**: The `method` function takes the graph `data` as input.\n- **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function computes the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink) in the graph. The `capacity` parameter specifies the edge attribute that holds the capacity values.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of buses that can be transported per hour from the North Mountain Gate to the South Lake Scenic Area without causing congestion.\n\nThe function call to retrieve the result is:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```"

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum flow between two nodes (Node 302 and Node 714) in an undirected graph with given capacity constraints on each road segment. The solution involves using a maximum flow algorithm, such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which is suitable for flow networks with capacity constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is a classic maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of flow (goods) that can be transported from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) without exceeding the capacity of any road segment.\n2. **Graph Representation**: The undirected graph is given, where each edge has a capacity. In an undirected graph, each edge can be represented as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method using BFS to find augmenting paths, is efficient for this problem. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` that computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a directed graph.\n4. **Handling Undirected Graph**: Since the graph is undirected, we need to ensure that each undirected edge is treated as two directed edges with the same capacity. NetworkX's flow algorithms handle this automatically if the graph is constructed correctly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714, capacity='capacity')\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Handling**: The function takes the undirected graph `data` as input. NetworkX's flow algorithms can handle undirected graphs by internally converting each undirected edge into two directed edges.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function computes the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714). The `capacity` parameter specifies the edge attribute that holds the capacity values.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum hourly goods dispatch flow achievable without causing congestion.\n\nThe function call to retrieve the maximum flow value is:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in algorithms to solve the maximum flow problem in an undirected graph, providing the optimal flow value between the specified nodes."

The problem can be modeled as a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph, where the edges have capacities representing the maximum number of vehicles that can pass simultaneously.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714 in an undirected graph. The maximum flow between two nodes in a graph is the maximum amount of flow (in this case, vehicles) that can be sent from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) without exceeding the capacity of any edge.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph, which internally uses an efficient algorithm.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - The function `method` will take the graph `data` as input.\n   - Use NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714.\n   - Return the computed maximum flow value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    return nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function `method(data)`**: This function takes the undirected graph `data` as input. The graph should be a NetworkX graph where edges have a 'capacity' attribute indicating the maximum flow each edge can handle.\n- **NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value`**: This function computes the maximum flow between the source node (302) and the sink node (714) in the graph. The function returns the value of the maximum flow, which represents the maximum number of vehicles that can be transported from the distribution center to the core warehouse without exceeding road capacities.\n- **Function Call**: The line `method(data)` calls the function with the provided graph data, and the return value is the maximum flow value, which is the desired numerical result.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem using standard graph algorithms provided by NetworkX, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."

It first checks if the input is a valid NetworkX graph and if the nodes 302 and 714 exist in the graph. If either node is missing, it returns 0, indicating no flow is possible.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: Using NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function, it computes the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714. This function efficiently calculates the flow using an appropriate algorithm (like Edmonds-Karp) and returns the flow value.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nThe function call `method(data)` will execute the function and return the maximum number of trucks that can be transported simultaneously from node 302 to node 714, adhering to the road capacity constraints."

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of batches of fully loaded fresh goods trucks that can stably pass from the distribution center (Node 302) to the core storage point (Node 714) per hour, considering the road network's connectivity structure. This is essentially a problem of finding the maximum flow between two nodes in an undirected graph where all edges have the same capacity (since all roads have the same transport capacity per unit time).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem reduces to finding the maximum flow from Node 302 (source) to Node 714 (sink) in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity. The maximum flow between these two nodes will give the maximum number of batches that can be transported per hour, assuming each edge has a capacity of 1 (since all roads have the same transport capacity per unit time, and we are considering batches as units).\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for computing the maximum flow in a flow network. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which can compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. For an undirected graph, NetworkX internally converts each undirected edge into two directed edges.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Use the given undirected graph `data`.\n   - Compute the maximum flow from Node 302 to Node 714 using NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function.\n   - Return the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of batches per hour.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    return nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function `method(data)`**: This function takes an undirected graph `data` (a NetworkX graph object) as input. It computes the maximum flow from Node 302 to Node 714 using `nx.maximum_flow_value`, which returns the value of the maximum flow. The function then returns this value.\n- **Function Call**: The line `method(data)` calls the function with the provided graph data, and the return value is the maximum number of batches that can be transported per hour from Node 302 to Node 714.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, providing the optimal solution for the given logistics scenario."

The goal is to determine the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths from Node 302 to Node 714, or equivalently, the maximum flow when each edge has a unit capacity.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or Edmonds-Karp algorithm (a specific implementation of Ford-Fulkerson using BFS) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems.

The `maximum_flow_value` function in NetworkX handles this internally.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes the input `data`, which is a NetworkX graph object.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from Node 302 (source) to Node 714 (sink). This function returns the value of the maximum flow, which in this context is the maximum number of batches of trucks that can be transported per hour, assuming each edge has a unit capacity.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nThe solution efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, providing the optimal number of batches that can be transported under the given constraints."

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of trucks that can be transported simultaneously from Node 302 to Node 714 in an undirected graph where some road sections have capacity limits. This is a classic maximum flow problem, which can be solved using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or any other algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network. \n\nHere, the undirected graph can be treated as a flow network where each undirected edge is replaced by two directed edges (in both directions) with the same capacity. The maximum flow from the source (Node 302) to the sink (Node 714) will give the maximum number of trucks that can be transported.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem as a Flow Network**: Convert the undirected graph into a directed graph where each undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v` with capacity `c` is replaced by two directed edges: `u -> v` with capacity `c` and `v -> u` with capacity `c`.\n2. **Compute Maximum Flow**: Use a maximum flow algorithm to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714). The value of this maximum flow will be the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Assuming data is a NetworkX graph\n    G = data\n    # Convert the undirected graph to a directed graph with bidirectional edges\n    directed_G = nx.DiGraph()\n    for u, v, attr in G.edges(data=True):\n        capacity = attr.get('capacity', 1)  # Assuming capacity is stored in edge attributes; default to 1 if not specified\n        directed_G.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n        directed_G.add_edge(v, u, capacity=capacity)\n    # Compute the maximum flow from 302 to 714\n    flow_value, _ = nx.maximum_flow(directed_G, 302, 714)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Conversion**: The undirected graph is converted into a directed graph to model the flow network. Each undirected edge is split into two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity. This allows flow to be sent in either direction, which is necessary for undirected edges in a flow network.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow` function from NetworkX is used to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714). This function returns the value of the maximum flow, which represents the maximum number of trucks that can be transported simultaneously from 302 to 714 given the road capacities.\n\nThe function `method` takes the graph data as input, processes it to form a directed flow network, and then computes the maximum flow, returning the result.\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```"

The solution involves using a maximum flow algorithm, such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which is suitable for finding the maximum flow in a flow network.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is to determine the maximum number of standard container goods that can be transported per hour from Node 302 to Node 714 in a bidirectional road network. The bidirectional roads imply that the graph is undirected, but for flow problems, we typically model each undirected edge as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The maximum flow problem can be efficiently solved using algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm by default.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - The function will take the graph data as input.\n   - Use the `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX to compute the maximum flow from Node 302 to Node 714.\n   - Return the computed maximum flow value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function `method(data)`**: This function takes the graph `data` (assumed to be a NetworkX graph) as input. It computes the maximum flow from Node 302 to Node 714 using NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function, which internally uses the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. The result is the maximum number of standard container goods that can be transported per hour between the two nodes.\n- **Function Call**: The line `method(data)` calls the function with the provided graph data, returning the maximum flow value directly. This value represents the optimal transport capacity under the given constraints. \n\nThis approach efficiently leverages existing graph algorithms to solve the maximum flow problem, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."

This is a classic maximum flow problem in an undirected graph, where each edge has a capacity representing the upper limit of trucks that can pass per unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding the maximum flow from Node 302 (source) to Node 714 (sink) in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity. The maximum flow can be computed using algorithms like the Edmonds-Karp algorithm (a BFS-based implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method) or using built-in functions from libraries like NetworkX.\n\n2. **NetworkX Solution**: NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. This function handles both directed and undirected graphs efficiently. For an undirected graph, NetworkX internally treats each undirected edge as two directed edges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714, capacity='capacity')\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes `data` as input, which is a NetworkX graph object representing the road network.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function uses `nx.maximum_flow_value` to compute the maximum flow from Node 302 to Node 714. The `capacity` parameter specifies the edge attribute that holds the capacity values.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of trucks that can be transported per unit time from the source to the destination without exceeding road capacities.\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\nThis line calls the `method` function with the provided graph data, returning the maximum flow value directly. The solution efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to handle the maximum flow computation in an undirected graph."

The roads are bidirectional, and each has a capacity limit on the number of trucks that can pass per unit time. \n\nThe solution involves using the maximum flow algorithm in an undirected graph. In NetworkX, we can convert the undirected graph into a directed graph by replacing each undirected edge with two directed edges (in opposite directions) with the same capacity.

The nodes represent locations (like transit stations and distribution centers), and the edges represent transport channels between these locations with certain capacities.

The graph should have edges with a 'capacity' attribute representing the maximum number of trucks that can traverse each channel per hour.\n- **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). This value represents the maximum number of trucks that can be transported per hour through the network without exceeding any channel capacities.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nThe solution efficiently leverages graph theory and network flow algorithms to solve the transportation bottleneck problem, providing the optimal number of trucks that can be transported per hour."

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the maximum number of trucks that can be simultaneously dispatched from the distribution center (Node 302) to the temporary warehouse (Node 714) within the given transportation network. This is essentially a maximum flow problem, where we want to find the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) in the undirected graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding the maximum flow in an undirected graph. In graph theory, the maximum flow between two nodes in a network is the maximum amount of flow (in this case, the number of trucks) that can be sent from the source to the sink without exceeding the capacity of any road (edge). Since the graph is undirected, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph using an efficient algorithm.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - The input is an undirected graph `data` in NetworkX format.\n   - The function will compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714.\n   - Since the problem states that each road has the same two-way traffic capacity, we can assume each edge has a capacity of 1 (unless specified otherwise). However, if the capacities are different, they should be provided in the graph. For this problem, since capacities are not specified, we assume each edge has a unit capacity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Assuming each edge has a capacity of 1 if not specified\n    # For undirected graphs, we need to represent each edge as two directed edges with the same capacity\n    # Check if the graph is directed; if not, convert it to a directed graph with bidirectional edges\n    if not data.is_directed():\n        directed_graph = data.to_directed()\n    else:\n        directed_graph = data.copy()\n    \n    # Assign a default capacity of 1 to each edge if not already present\n    for u, v in directed_graph.edges():\n        if 'capacity' not in directed_graph[u][v]:\n            directed_graph[u][v]['capacity'] = 1\n    \n    # Compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(directed_graph, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Handling**: The function first checks if the input graph is undirected. If it is, the graph is converted to a directed graph with bidirectional edges to facilitate flow calculation.\n2. **Edge Capacity**: Each edge is assigned a default capacity of 1 if no capacity is specified. This is crucial because the maximum flow algorithm relies on edge capacities to determine the flow.\n3. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX is used to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714). This function efficiently calculates the flow using an underlying algorithm like Edmonds-Karp, which is a variation of the Ford-Fulkerson method.\n4. **Result**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of trucks that can be simultaneously dispatched from the distribution center to the warehouse within the given network constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging graph theory concepts and NetworkX's built-in functions to handle maximum flow calculations in both directed and undirected graphs."

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the maximum hourly transport capacity from node 302 to node 714 in the given road network. This is essentially a maximum flow problem, where the goal is to determine the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) in the undirected graph, considering the capacity constraints of the edges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding the maximum flow between two nodes in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge can carry flow in both directions, but the total flow in both directions cannot exceed the edge's capacity. However, NetworkX's maximum flow functions typically handle directed graphs. To model an undirected graph, each undirected edge must be represented as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between a source and sink in a directed graph, which we can use here by appropriately converting the undirected graph into a directed graph with bidirectional edges.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Convert the undirected graph into a directed graph by adding bidirectional edges.\n   - Use the `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX to compute the maximum flow from the source to the sink.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Assuming data is a NetworkX undirected graph\n    # Create a directed graph with bidirectional edges\n    directed_graph = nx.DiGraph()\n    for u, v, attr in data.edges(data=True):\n        capacity = attr.get('capacity', 1)  # Assuming default capacity is 1 if not specified\n        directed_graph.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n        directed_graph.add_edge(v, u, capacity=capacity)\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(directed_graph, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Conversion**: The undirected graph is converted into a directed graph by adding two directed edges (u → v and v → u) for each undirected edge (u-v). This allows flow to be sent in either direction, which is necessary for modeling the undirected nature of the road network.\n2. **Capacity Handling**: Each directed edge is assigned the same capacity as the original undirected edge. If the capacity is not specified, it defaults to 1, assuming each road section can carry at least one unit of flow.\n3. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function computes the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) in the directed graph. This value represents the maximum hourly transport capacity between the two nodes, considering the capacity constraints of the road sections.\n\nThe function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the answer to the problem. The function call `method(data)` will execute the function and return the desired numerical result."

The maximum flow will represent the maximum number of trucks that can be dispatched daily without overloading any road segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem as a Flow Network**: The problem can be modeled as a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. Each edge in the graph has a capacity, which represents the maximum number of trucks that can traverse the road segment per day.\n2. **Convert Undirected Graph to Directed Graph**: Since NetworkX's maximum flow algorithms typically work with directed graphs, we need to convert each undirected edge into two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.\n3. **Compute Maximum Flow**: Use NetworkX's `maximum_flow` function to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714). The value of this flow will give the maximum number of trucks that can be dispatched daily.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Create a directed graph\n    G = nx.DiGraph()\n    \n    # Add edges with capacities in both directions for undirected edges\n    for u, v, attr in data.edges(data=True):\n        capacity = attr.get('capacity', 0)  # Assuming capacity is stored in edge attributes\n        G.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n        G.add_edge(v, u, capacity=capacity)\n    \n    # Compute the maximum flow from 302 to 714\n    flow_value, _ = nx.maximum_flow(G, 302, 714)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Construction**: The function starts by creating a directed graph (DiGraph) in NetworkX. For each undirected edge in the input graph, two directed edges are added to the DiGraph, one in each direction, both with the same capacity as the original undirected edge.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow` function is used to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714). This function returns the flow value, which is the maximum number of trucks that can be transported from 302 to 714 without exceeding the capacity of any road segment.\n3. **Return Result**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThe function call to retrieve the result would be:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n``` \n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem using graph theory and leverages NetworkX's built-in algorithms to compute the solution.

The solution involves using a maximum flow algorithm, such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which is suitable for flow networks with capacity constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is a classic maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of cargo (flow) that can be transported from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) without exceeding the capacity of any road segment (edge).\n2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is undirected, meaning each edge can carry flow in both directions. However, the total flow in both directions must not exceed the edge's capacity. In flow network terms, each undirected edge is represented as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method using BFS to find augmenting paths, is efficient for this problem. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` that computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a directed graph.\n4. **Handling Undirected Edges**: Since the graph is undirected, we need to ensure that for each undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`, we add two directed edges (`u` to `v` and `v` to `u`) each with the same capacity as the original undirected edge.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # The graph data is assumed to be an undirected graph in NetworkX format\n    G = data\n    \n    # Create a directed graph to represent the flow network\n    flow_graph = nx.DiGraph()\n    \n    # Add edges with capacities in both directions for each undirected edge\n    for u, v, attr in G.edges(data=True):\n        capacity = attr['capacity'] if 'capacity' in attr else 0\n        flow_graph.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n        flow_graph.add_edge(v, u, capacity=capacity)\n    \n    # Compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(flow_graph, 302, 714)\n    \n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Conversion**: The undirected graph `data` is converted into a directed graph `flow_graph` where each undirected edge is split into two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.

The goal is to determine the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714).

The goal is to determine the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714). In graph theory, the maximum flow between two nodes is the maximum amount of flow (in this case, the number of vehicle loads) that can be sent from the source to the sink without exceeding the capacity of any edge in the graph.\n2. **NetworkX Library**: The NetworkX library in Python provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. This function will be used to solve the problem efficiently.\n3. **Undirected Graph Handling**: Since the graph is undirected, each edge can carry flow in both directions.

This is essentially a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph, where the edges have capacities representing the traffic flow restrictions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem as a Maximum Flow Problem**: The problem can be modeled using a flow network where nodes represent locations and edges represent roads with capacities (maximum flow possible per hour). The goal is to find the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714).\n2. **Use NetworkX to Compute Maximum Flow**: NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which can compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph.

We convert this into a directed graph where each undirected edge is split into two directed edges (both directions) to model bidirectional roads.\n2. **Capacity Handling**: Each edge in the original graph is assumed to have a 'capacity' attribute, which represents the maximum flow (in tons per hour) that the road can handle during the morning rush hour.\n3. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: Using NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function, we compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714).

Each edge in the graph has a capacity that limits the flow through it.\n2. **Key Insight**: In an undirected graph, each bidirectional edge can be represented as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity. The maximum flow from the source to the target can then be computed using a standard maximum flow algorithm.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson method (or its variant, the Edmonds-Karp algorithm) is suitable here. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` that computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a directed graph, which we can use after converting the undirected graph into a directed graph with bidirectional edges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # The graph is undirected, but for max flow, we treat each undirected edge as two directed edges\n    directed_graph = nx.DiGraph()\n    for u, v, attr in data.edges(data=True):\n        capacity = attr.get('capacity', 1)  # Assuming the capacity is stored under 'capacity' attribute\n        directed_graph.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n        directed_graph.add_edge(v, u, capacity=capacity)\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(directed_graph, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Conversion**: The undirected graph is converted into a directed graph by adding two directed edges (in both directions) for each undirected edge. This allows the use of directed graph algorithms for maximum flow calculation.\n2. **Capacity Handling**: Each edge's capacity is preserved during the conversion. If the capacity is not specified, it defaults to 1, though the problem statement implies capacities are provided.\n3. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX computes the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the target node (714) in the directed graph, which effectively gives the maximum number of rescue vehicles that can be transported per unit time.\n\nThe function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the solution to the problem.\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```"

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of rescue vehicles that can simultaneously reach the disaster site (node 714) from the starting point (node 302) without path conflicts in the given transportation network. This is a classic maximum flow problem, where the goal is to determine the maximum flow from the source (302) to the sink (714) in the undirected graph, considering the capacity constraints of each road section.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be modeled as a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. Each edge in the graph has a certain capacity, which represents the maximum number of vehicles (flow) that can pass through that road section simultaneously. The solution involves computing the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) using an algorithm like the Edmonds-Karp algorithm (which is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method using BFS for finding augmenting paths).\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm is suitable here because it efficiently handles the maximum flow problem in polynomial time, especially for graphs where edge capacities are integers. The algorithm works by repeatedly finding the shortest augmenting path from the source to the sink and then increasing the flow along this path until no more augmenting paths exist.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Convert the undirected graph into a directed graph with two directed edges (u to v and v to u) for each undirected edge, each with the same capacity as the original undirected edge.\n   - Use the `maximum_flow` function from the NetworkX library, which internally uses an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum flow between the source and sink nodes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    source = 302\n    target = 714\n    flow_value, flow_dict = nx.maximum_flow(G, source, target)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Handling**: The function takes the undirected graph `data` as input. The graph is expected to be a NetworkX graph object where each edge has a 'capacity' attribute. If the edges do not have a capacity attribute, NetworkX will assume an infinite capacity, which is not the case here as the problem states each road section has limited capacity.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow` function is used to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the target node (714). This function returns two values: the maximum flow value and a dictionary representing the flow through each edge. The function returns only the maximum flow value, which is the answer to the problem.\n3. **Efficiency**: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implemented in NetworkX runs in O(V*E^2) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is efficient for the problem constraints typically encountered in such scenarios.\n\nThe function call to retrieve the result is:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```"

This is a classic maximum flow problem, where the edges have capacities representing the maximum traffic capacity per unit time. The solution involves computing the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) in the given undirected graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding the maximum flow in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity. The maximum flow from the source (302) to the sink (714) will give the maximum number of rescue vehicles that can be transported per unit time.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph, which internally uses an efficient algorithm.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Use the `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714 in the given graph.\n   - The graph is undirected, but NetworkX handles this by treating each undirected edge as two directed edges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function `method(data)`**: This function takes a NetworkX graph `data` as input. The graph represents the transportation network with nodes and edges, where each edge has a capacity attribute indicating the maximum traffic it can handle per unit time.\n- **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function uses `nx.maximum_flow_value` to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). This value represents the maximum number of rescue vehicles that can be transported simultaneously per unit time without congestion.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nThe approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, ensuring optimal performance and correctness. The solution is concise and directly addresses the problem requirements."

The solution involves using a maximum flow algorithm, such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which is suitable for this scenario.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is essentially a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. The goal is to find the maximum amount of flow (in this case, rescue supplies in tons per hour) that can be transported from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) given the capacities of the roads (edges).\n2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is undirected, meaning each edge can carry flow in both directions. However, the total flow in both directions combined cannot exceed the edge's capacity. In NetworkX, we can handle this by adding directed edges in both directions for each undirected edge, each with the same capacity.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm (a specific implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method using BFS to find augmenting paths) is efficient for this problem.

This allows the flow to be sent in either direction, but the total flow in both directions is constrained by the edge's capacity.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function computes the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) in the directed graph. This function uses an efficient algorithm (like Edmonds-Karp) to find the maximum possible flow, which represents the maximum traffic capacity (or supply transport rate) between the two points under the given constraints.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nThe function call to retrieve the result is:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```"

It uses the `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). The result, which is the maximum number of rescue teams that can be sent, is returned.\n- **Function Call**: The line `method(data)` calls the function with the provided graph data, and the return value is the maximum flow value, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging NetworkX's built-in maximum flow algorithm, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."

This is a classic maximum flow problem, which can be solved using algorithms like the Edmonds-Karp algorithm (a specific implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method using BFS for finding augmenting paths).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires computing the maximum flow from a source node (302) to a sink node (714) in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity. The maximum flow from the source to the sink will give the maximum number of rescue teams that can be sent simultaneously.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm is suitable here because it efficiently computes the maximum flow in a flow network by using BFS to find the shortest augmenting path in each iteration. This ensures the algorithm runs in polynomial time (O(V*E^2)).\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Convert the undirected graph into a directed graph by replacing each undirected edge with two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.\n   - Use the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # The graph is undirected, but for max flow, we can treat each edge as two directed edges\n    # NetworkX's max_flow function handles this internally for undirected graphs\n    flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Handling**: The function `method` takes the input graph `data` (assumed to be a NetworkX graph) and computes the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714. NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function is used, which internally converts the undirected edges into bidirectional edges with the same capacity and then computes the maximum flow using an appropriate algorithm (like Edmonds-Karp).\n\n2. **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of rescue teams that can be sent from node 302 to node 714 simultaneously, considering the road capacities.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging NetworkX's built-in functions, which are optimized for such computations, ensuring correctness and performance."

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the maximum flow from a source node (302) to a sink node (714) in an undirected graph. The graph is represented in NetworkX format, and each edge has a capacity representing the number of rescue vehicle teams that can pass through the road per unit time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The task is to find the maximum flow between two nodes in an undirected graph. In NetworkX, the `maximum_flow` function can compute this. For an undirected graph, each edge is treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.\n2. **NetworkX Function**: The `maximum_flow_value` function in NetworkX directly returns the maximum flow value between a source and sink node, which is efficient for this problem.\n3. **Input Handling**: The function will take the graph data as input, which is already in NetworkX format, and use the source and sink nodes provided (302 and 714).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    return nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The `method` function takes the graph `data` as input. Inside the function, it uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714.\n2. **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum flow value, which is the maximum number of rescue vehicle teams that can be transported from the source to the sink per unit time.\n3. **Function Call**: The function is called with `data` as the argument, which should be the NetworkX graph object containing the traffic network information. The result is the numerical value of the maximum flow.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, providing the required result in a concise manner."

The edges in the graph represent roads, and the capacities of these edges represent the maximum number of vehicles that can traverse the road simultaneously.

The `capacity` parameter specifies the edge attribute that holds the capacity values.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of power supply vehicles that can be simultaneously dispatched from node 302 to node 714.\n\nThe function call `method(data)` will execute the function and return the desired numerical value, which is the solution to the problem."

This is essentially a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph, where the capacity of each edge represents the transport capacity per unit time (likely determined by the number of lanes).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink) in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity. The maximum flow between these two nodes will give the maximum stable hourly救援物资输送量.\n2. **NetworkX for Maximum Flow**: NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. This function handles the underlying algorithms (like Edmonds-Karp or Dinic's algorithm) to find the maximum flow.\n3. **Input Handling**: The function `method(data)` will take the graph data (assumed to be a NetworkX graph) as input. The graph should have edge attributes indicating the capacity (likely stored under a key like 'capacity' or 'weight').\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714, capacity='capacity')\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method(data)` is defined to take a NetworkX graph `data` as input.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function uses `nx.maximum_flow_value` to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714. The parameter `capacity='capacity'` specifies that the edge attribute 'capacity' should be used to determine the flow capacities. If the capacity attribute has a different name, this parameter should be adjusted accordingly.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum stable hourly救援物资输送量 from node 302 to node 714.\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\nThis line calls the function `method` with the graph `data` as input, returning the maximum flow value directly. The solution efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem in an undirected graph, providing the desired result."

The solution involves computing the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) using a suitable algorithm.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is a classic maximum flow problem.

The maximum flow between these nodes will determine the maximum number of equipment-laden ambulances that can be dispatched simultaneously per hour.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink) in an undirected graph. In graph theory, the maximum flow between two nodes is the maximum amount of flow (or traffic) that can be sent from the source to the sink, considering the capacity constraints of the edges.\n2. **NetworkX Library**: NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. For an undirected graph, each edge is treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.\n3. **Edge Capacities**: The problem does not specify edge capacities, so we assume each edge has a default capacity of 1. This means each edge can handle one unit of flow (e.g., one ambulance per hour). If the graph has explicit capacities, they should be used instead.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes a NetworkX graph `data` as input.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). This function returns the value of the maximum flow, which represents the maximum traffic capacity between the two nodes.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the answer to the problem.\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\nThis line calls the function `method` with the graph `data` as an argument and returns the maximum flow value between nodes 302 and 714. The result is a numerical value indicating the maximum number of equipment-laden ambulances that can be dispatched per hour."

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum flow from the reserve center (Node 302) to the core disaster area (Node 714) in an undirected graph where edges have capacity constraints. The solution involves using a maximum flow algorithm, such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm or any other suitable method provided by NetworkX.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is a classic maximum flow problem where we need to determine the maximum amount of flow (rescue supplies) that can be sent from a source node (302) to a sink node (714) in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. This function uses an efficient algorithm (like Edmonds-Karp) under the hood.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - The input graph `data` is assumed to be a NetworkX graph.\n   - Use the `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714.\n   - Return the computed maximum flow value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    max_flow = nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `method(data)`**:\n   - This function takes a NetworkX graph `data` as input.\n   - It uses the `nx.maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink) in the graph. The function handles the conversion of undirected edges into directed edges with capacities automatically.\n   - The result, which is the maximum flow value, is returned.\n\n2. **Function Call**:\n   - The line `method(data)` calls the function with the provided graph `data` and returns the maximum flow value directly. This value represents the maximum number of standard truck units of rescue supplies that can be transported per hour from node 302 to node 714 without exceeding any road capacity limits.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."

The maximum flow will represent the maximum amount of rescue supplies that can be delivered per hour without causing congestion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is a classic maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. The goal is to find the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714). In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which can compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Use the provided undirected graph `data`.\n   - Compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714 using NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function.\n   - Return the computed maximum flow value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    max_flow = nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `method(data)`**:\n   - This function takes the undirected graph `data` as input.\n   - It uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink) in the graph.\n   - The result, which is the maximum flow value, is returned.\n2. **Function Call**:\n   - The line `method(data)` calls the function with the provided graph data, returning the maximum flow value directly.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, ensuring optimal performance and correctness. The solution adheres to the problem constraints and returns the desired numerical value in the specified format."

However, since the problem states that the two-way roads have the same traffic capacity but doesn't specify the value, we can proceed under the assumption that each edge's capacity is 1, and the maximum flow value will represent the number of edge-disjoint paths or similar, which translates to the maximum traffic capacity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Assuming the graph is undirected and each edge has capacity 1 unless specified otherwise\n    # Since the problem states roads have same traffic capacity but doesn't specify, we assume 1 per edge\n    flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function `method(data)`**: This function takes a NetworkX graph `data` as input.

The function computes the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714 using NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function, which efficiently solves the max-flow problem. The result is the maximum number of rescue vehicles that can be sent per hour from the supply point to the disaster-affected area.\n- **Function Call**: The line `method(data)` invokes the function with the provided graph data, returning the numerical value of the maximum flow, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages existing graph algorithms to solve the problem, ensuring correctness and optimal performance."

The graph should be directed, but since the original graph is undirected, we need to convert each undirected edge into two directed edges with the same capacity. The `maximum_flow_value` function can then be used to find the solution efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Assuming data is a NetworkX undirected graph\n    # Create a directed graph with edges in both directions\n    directed_graph = nx.DiGraph()\n    for u, v, attr in data.edges(data=True):\n        capacity = attr.get('capacity', 1)  # Assuming default capacity is 1 if not specified\n        directed_graph.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n        directed_graph.add_edge(v, u, capacity=capacity)\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(directed_graph, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Conversion**: The undirected graph `data` is converted into a directed graph where each undirected edge is replaced by two directed edges (both directions). This allows the use of maximum flow algorithms designed for directed graphs.\n2. **Capacity Handling**: Each edge in the original graph is assumed to have a capacity attribute. If not specified, a default capacity of 1 is used. The directed edges inherit the same capacities as the original undirected edges.\n3. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function computes the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) in the directed graph. This value represents the maximum number of rescue vehicles that can be dispatched per hour without congestion.\n4. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's capabilities to solve the maximum flow problem in an undirected graph by converting it into a directed graph and applying standard maximum flow algorithms."

The maximum flow will give us the theoretical maximum number of standard buses that can pass through the route per hour.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem is essentially a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. The goal is to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714). In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.\n2. **NetworkX Library**: NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which can compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a directed graph. For an undirected graph, we need to represent each undirected edge as two directed edges.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The `maximum_flow_value` function in NetworkX uses an efficient algorithm (like Edmonds-Karp or Dinic's algorithm) to compute the maximum flow. The function returns the value of the maximum flow, which is the answer we need.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # The graph is undirected, but maximum_flow requires directed edges.\n    # So, we create a directed graph with edges in both directions for each undirected edge.\n    directed_graph = nx.DiGraph()\n    for u, v, attr in data.edges(data=True):\n        capacity = attr.get('capacity', 0)  # Assuming the capacity is stored under 'capacity' attribute\n        directed_graph.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n        directed_graph.add_edge(v, u, capacity=capacity)\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(directed_graph, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Conversion**: The function starts by converting the undirected graph into a directed graph. Each undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v` is replaced by two directed edges: one from `u` to `v` and another from `v` to `u`, both with the same capacity as the original undirected edge.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function is then used to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) in the directed graph. This function efficiently calculates the maximum possible flow between the two nodes, respecting the capacity constraints of the edges.\n3. **Return Value**: The result of the maximum flow calculation is returned, which represents the theoretical maximum number of standard buses that can pass through the route per hour.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages graph theory and NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the problem with optimal performance."

NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph using an efficient algorithm.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Use the `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714.\n   - The graph is undirected, but NetworkX handles this internally by treating each undirected edge as two directed edges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    return nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function `method(data)`**: This function takes a NetworkX graph `data` as input. It uses the `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714. The result is the maximum number of buses (or units of flow) that can be transported per hour from the source to the sink node.\n- **Function Call**: The line `method(data)` calls the function with the provided graph data, returning the numerical value of the maximum flow between the specified nodes.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging NetworkX's built-in algorithms, which are optimized for performance and correctness. The solution adheres to the problem constraints and returns the required numerical value directly."

The graph is undirected, which means each edge can carry flow in both directions, but the total flow in both directions combined cannot exceed the edge's capacity.

For the sake of this problem, we'll assume each edge has a capacity of 1 unless stated otherwise.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method using BFS to find augmenting paths, is efficient for this purpose.

This is essentially a maximum flow problem, where we want to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714 in the given graph. The edges in the graph represent roads with certain capacities (traffic restrictions), and the maximum flow will give us the maximum number of bus trips that can be dispatched per hour.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is a classic maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. The goal is to find the maximum number of paths (or flow) from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) such that the flow through each edge does not exceed its capacity. \n2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is given as an undirected graph in NetworkX format. For maximum flow computation in an undirected graph, each undirected edge can be treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We can use the `maximum_flow` function from NetworkX, which implements an algorithm to compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. The function returns the value of the maximum flow, which is the answer we need.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes the graph `data` as input. The graph is expected to be a NetworkX graph object.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). This function abstracts away the complexities of the underlying algorithm (typically Edmonds-Karp or another efficient method) and directly returns the maximum flow value.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of bus trips that can be dispatched per hour from node 302 to node 714 under the given traffic constraints.\n\nThe solution efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the problem concisely and correctly.

The maximum flow from the source (302) to the sink (714) will give the maximum number of buses that can be sent per hour, considering the capacity constraints of the road segments.\n\n2. **NetworkX Solution**: NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph.

For an undirected graph, it internally treats each undirected edge as two directed edges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    for u, v, capacity in data.edges(data='capacity'):\n        G.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n    max_flow = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Construction**: The function starts by constructing an undirected graph `G` from the given `data`.

This function efficiently calculates the maximum number of units (buses, in this context) that can flow from the source to the sink without exceeding the capacity of any edge.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of bus departures per hour that can be scheduled from station 302 to station 714.\n\nThis approach leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to handle the maximum flow calculation, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

This essentially translates to finding the maximum flow between these two nodes in the undirected graph, as the maximum flow represents the maximum number of disjoint paths (or the capacity) between the source and sink nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to determine the line capacity between nodes 302 and 714, which is a classic maximum flow problem. In graph theory, the maximum flow between two nodes is the maximum amount of flow (in this case, the number of train trips) that can be sent from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) without exceeding the capacity of any edge in the graph. Since the graph is undirected, each edge can be treated as two directed edges with the same capacity in both directions.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph using an efficient algorithm.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - The input `data` is assumed to be a NetworkX graph.\n   - Use the `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714.\n   - Return the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of train trips possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    return nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function `method(data)`**: This function takes a NetworkX graph `data` as input. It uses the `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). The result is returned as an integer representing the maximum number of train trips that can be scheduled between these nodes under the given constraints.\n- **Function Call**: The line `method(data)` calls the function with the provided graph data, and the return value is the maximum flow value, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages graph theory to solve the problem by treating it as a maximum flow problem, providing an optimal solution using NetworkX's built-in functions."

The solution involves using a maximum flow algorithm, such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which is suitable for flow networks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is essentially a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. The goal is to find the maximum number of trains (flow) that can be dispatched from station 302 to station 714 without exceeding the capacity of any track section (edge).\n2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is undirected, meaning each edge can carry flow in both directions. However, for maximum flow algorithms, we typically represent each undirected edge as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm (a specific implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method using BFS to find augmenting paths) is efficient for this problem. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` that computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a directed graph, which we can use here after properly converting the undirected graph into a directed one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Create a directed graph from the undirected data\n    directed_graph = nx.DiGraph()\n    for u, v, capacity in data.edges(data='capacity'):\n        directed_graph.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n        directed_graph.add_edge(v, u, capacity=capacity)\n    \n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(directed_graph, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Conversion**: The undirected graph `data` is converted into a directed graph by adding two directed edges for each undirected edge, one in each direction, both with the same capacity. This allows the flow to be sent in either direction.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function is used to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink) in the directed graph. This function efficiently calculates the maximum possible flow by finding augmenting paths and updating the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n3. **Result**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the theoretical maximum number of train dispatches from station 302 to station 714 given the track capacities.\n\nThe function call to retrieve the result would be:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```"

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of through trains that can be coordinated per hour between Station 302 and Station 714 in a subway line, given the maximum one-way capacity of each track section. This is essentially a maximum flow problem in a directed graph where the capacities of the edges represent the maximum number of trains per hour that can pass through each track section.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem as a Flow Network**: The subway stations can be represented as nodes in a graph, and the track sections between stations are directed edges with capacities equal to the maximum number of trains per hour that can pass through them.\n2. **Compute Maximum Flow**: Using a maximum flow algorithm (such as Edmonds-Karp or Dinic's algorithm), compute the maximum flow from the source node (Station 302) to the sink node (Station 714). The value of this maximum flow will give the maximum number of through trains per hour that can be coordinated between the two stations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Assuming 'data' is a NetworkX graph with edge capacities\n    # The source is station 302 and the sink is station 714\n    source = 302\n    sink = 714\n    # Compute the maximum flow from source to sink\n    flow_value, _ = nx.maximum_flow(data, source, sink)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Representation**: The input `data` is expected to be a NetworkX graph where nodes represent subway stations and edges represent track sections between stations. Each edge has a capacity attribute indicating the maximum number of trains per hour that can traverse that section.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow` function, which implements the Edmonds-Karp algorithm (a variation of the Ford-Fulkerson method) to compute the maximum flow from the source node (Station 302) to the sink node (Station 714). The result is the maximum number of trains that can be sent from Station 302 to Station 714 per hour without exceeding the capacity of any track section.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which directly answers the problem's requirement.\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\nThis line calls the function `method` with the provided `data` (the NetworkX graph) and returns the maximum flow value, which is the maximum number of through trains per hour between the specified stations."

The solution involves finding the maximum flow between the two nodes in the undirected graph, which represents the maximum traffic capacity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem is essentially about finding the maximum flow between two nodes (302 and 714) in an undirected graph. The edges in the graph represent segments with bidirectional bus lanes, and the capacities of these edges determine the maximum flow (number of buses) that can pass through the route.\n2. **Network Flow Algorithms**: The maximum flow between two nodes in a graph can be found using algorithms like the Edmonds-Karp algorithm or Dinic's algorithm. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which can compute this efficiently.\n3. **Undirected Graph Handling**: Since the graph is undirected, each edge's capacity is effectively the same in both directions. NetworkX's flow functions handle undirected graphs by treating each undirected edge as two directed edges with the given capacity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes the graph `data` as input.

The maximum flow between the source (302) and the sink (714) will give the maximum number of buses that can traverse the route per hour, assuming each edge's capacity represents the number of bidirectional lanes (which determines the maximum flow per segment).\n2. **Graph Handling**: Since the graph is undirected, each undirected edge can be represented as two directed edges in opposite directions, each with the same capacity as the original undirected edge.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or any of its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for computing the maximum flow in a flow network.

This allows the use of maximum flow algorithms designed for directed graphs.\n2. **Capacity Handling**: Each edge's capacity is taken from the graph's edge attributes. If no capacity is specified, it defaults to 1, assuming each lane allows at least one bus per time unit.\n3. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX computes the maximum flow between the source (302) and sink (714) nodes, which directly gives the maximum number of buses that can traverse the route per hour under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages graph theory to solve the traffic capacity problem by modeling it as a maximum flow problem, providing the theoretical upper limit of bus coordination on the specified route."

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the maximum throughput (or flow) between two nodes (Station 302 and Station 714) in an undirected graph. The maximum flow between these two nodes will give us the theoretical maximum number of train trips that can be dispatched per minute, assuming each edge has a capacity of 1 (since the problem does not specify otherwise).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is essentially a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. The goal is to find the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths between the source (Station 302) and the sink (Station 714), or equivalently, the maximum flow when each edge has a unit capacity.\n2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is given as an undirected graph in NetworkX format. In NetworkX, we can use the `maximum_flow` function to compute the maximum flow between two nodes. For an undirected graph, each edge is treated as two directed edges (in both directions), each with the same capacity.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The Edmonds-Karp algorithm (a specific implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method using BFS) is suitable here, but NetworkX's `maximum_flow` function will handle the underlying algorithm efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    source = 302\n    target = 714\n    if source not in G or target not in G:\n        return 0\n    flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, source, target)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes the graph `data` as input.\n2. **Check Nodes**: It first checks if both the source (302) and target (714) nodes are present in the graph. If either is missing, it returns 0 as no flow is possible.\n3. **Compute Maximum Flow**: Using NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function, it computes the maximum flow between the source and target nodes. This function returns the value of the maximum flow, which in this context (with unit capacities) represents the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths or train trips per minute.\n4. **Return Flow Value**: The computed flow value is returned as the result.\n\nThe function efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in methods to solve the maximum flow problem, providing the desired throughput between the specified stations. The solution assumes that each edge in the graph can handle one unit of flow (i.e., one train per minute per track), which is a standard assumption unless specified otherwise. \n\nThe single line of code to call this function is:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```"

The problem can be modeled as finding the maximum flow between these two nodes in a flow network, where the edges represent track sections with given capacities.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem as a Flow Network**: The subway line can be represented as a directed or undirected graph where nodes are stations and edges are track sections between stations. Each edge has a capacity representing the maximum number of trains that can pass through that section per unit time.\n2. **Compute Maximum Flow**: The maximum transport capacity between the source (Hub Station 302) and the sink (Terminal Station 714) is equivalent to the maximum flow in this network. The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or any other maximum flow algorithm can be used to compute this value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Assuming data is a NetworkX graph with edge capacities\n    # The function computes the maximum flow between node 302 and node 714\n    flow_value, _ = nx.maximum_flow(data, 302, 714)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes a NetworkX graph `data` as input.

We will use this function after converting the undirected graph into a directed graph with bidirectional edges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Create a directed graph\n    directed_graph = nx.DiGraph()\n    \n    # Add edges from the undirected graph as two directed edges in the directed graph\n    for u, v, attr in data.edges(data=True):\n        capacity = attr.get('capacity', 0)  # Assuming the capacity is stored under the 'capacity' attribute\n        directed_graph.add_edge(u, v, capacity=capacity)\n        directed_graph.add_edge(v, u, capacity=capacity)\n    \n    # Compute the maximum flow from 302 to 714\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(directed_graph, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Conversion**: The undirected graph `data` is converted into a directed graph by adding two directed edges (u → v and v → u) for each undirected edge (u, v) in the original graph. Both directed edges are assigned the same capacity as the original undirected edge.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX is used to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) in the directed graph. This function efficiently calculates the maximum number of trains (flow) that can be routed from the source to the sink per hour, respecting the capacity constraints of each track section.\n3. **Result**: The result returned is the maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of direct train trips per hour that can be scheduled from Station 302 to Station 714 under the given network constraints.\n\nThe function call to retrieve the result is:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```"

This is essentially a maximum flow problem, where we want to find the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714 in the given undirected graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem as a Flow Network**: The road network can be modeled as a flow network where each edge has a certain capacity (the number of buses that can traverse the road per hour). Since the graph is undirected, each undirected edge can be represented as two directed edges in opposite directions, each with the same capacity.\n2. **Compute Maximum Flow**: Using a maximum flow algorithm (such as Edmonds-Karp or Dinic's algorithm), we can compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714). The value of this maximum flow will give the maximum number of buses that can be dispatched per hour.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # Assuming 'data' is a NetworkX graph\n    G = data\n    # Check if both nodes exist in the graph\n    if 302 not in G or 714 not in G:\n        return 0\n    # Compute the maximum flow between 302 (source) and 714 (sink)\n    # For undirected graphs, NetworkX handles it by treating each edge as two directed edges\n    flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Handling**: The function starts by checking if both the source (302) and sink (714) nodes are present in the graph. If either node is missing, the function returns 0, indicating no buses can be dispatched.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function then uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714. This function efficiently calculates the maximum flow using an appropriate algorithm (like Edmonds-Karp), which is suitable for most practical scenarios.\n3. **Return Value**: The result of the maximum flow calculation is returned, representing the maximum number of buses that can be dispatched per hour from station 302 to station 714 under the given road network constraints.\n\nThe function call to retrieve the result would be:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```"

The maximum throughput between two nodes in a network is equivalent to the maximum flow that can be sent from the source node to the target node, considering the capacities of the edges in the network.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum flow between two specific nodes in an undirected graph. In graph theory, the maximum flow between two nodes is the highest amount of flow (or throughput) that can be routed from the source node to the target node without exceeding the capacity of any edge in the network.\n2. **NetworkX Library**: The NetworkX library in Python provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. This function uses the Edmonds-Karp algorithm (or other efficient algorithms) under the hood to compute the maximum flow.\n3. **Graph Representation**: The graph is undirected, but the maximum flow problem is typically solved on directed graphs. However, NetworkX handles undirected graphs by treating each undirected edge as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity.\n4. **Edge Capacities**: The problem statement implies that the graph edges have capacities. If the graph does not have a 'capacity' attribute on edges, it might assume infinite capacity, which would not make sense for throughput calculations. However, the problem states that the graph is structured in NetworkX format, so we assume that edge capacities are properly defined.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes the graph `data` as input, which is assumed to be a NetworkX graph object.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function uses `nx.maximum_flow_value` to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (Zhongshan Park Station) to node 714 (Century Avenue Transfer Station). This function returns the value of the maximum flow, which represents the maximum throughput between the two nodes.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nThe function call `method(data)` will execute the function and return the numerical value of the maximum throughput between the specified stations. The solution efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to handle the complex graph computations, providing an optimal and correct result."

This is essentially a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph, where the edges have capacities representing the maximum number of trains that can pass through each track section.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires computing the maximum flow between two nodes (302 and 714) in an undirected graph. In graph theory, the maximum flow between two nodes is the maximum amount of flow (in this case, trains) that can be sent from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) without exceeding the capacity of any edge. For an undirected graph, each undirected edge can be treated as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph using an efficient algorithm.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - The function will take the graph data (assumed to be in NetworkX format) as input.\n   - The function will compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714.\n   - The result will be the value of this maximum flow, which is returned as the output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    return nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714, capacity='capacity')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Importing NetworkX**: The `networkx` library is used to handle graph operations. The `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX is particularly useful here as it directly returns the maximum flow value between two nodes without needing to process the flow network further.\n- **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes the graph `data` as input. The graph is expected to be an undirected graph where each edge has a 'capacity' attribute indicating the maximum number of trains that can traverse that edge.\n- **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function calls `nx.maximum_flow_value` with the graph, source node (302), sink node (714), and specifies that the edge attribute 'capacity' should be used for flow capacities. The result is the maximum number of trains that can be routed from 302 to 714, which is returned directly.\n\nThe single line of code to call this function is:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\nThis line will execute the function and return the maximum flow value between the specified stations."

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of buses that can be transported per hour from the temporary assembly point (Node 302) to the transportation hub (Node 714) in an undirected graph where each road has a limited capacity. This is a classic maximum flow problem, which can be solved using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or any other algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding the maximum flow from Node 302 (source) to Node 714 (sink) in an undirected graph. Each edge in the graph has a capacity that limits the flow (number of buses) that can pass through it per unit time. The solution involves converting the undirected graph into a directed graph where each undirected edge is replaced by two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity. Then, we can apply a maximum flow algorithm to determine the maximum number of buses that can be transported from the source to the sink.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for this problem. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` that computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph, which internally uses an efficient algorithm.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - The input is a NetworkX graph `data` representing the undirected graph with edge capacities.\n   - Use the `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX to compute the maximum flow from Node 302 to Node 714.\n   - Return the computed maximum flow value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    return nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714, capacity='capacity')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Importing NetworkX**: The `networkx` library is imported to utilize its graph algorithms.\n- **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes the graph `data` as input.\n- **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function is used to compute the maximum flow from Node 302 (source) to Node 714 (sink). The parameter `capacity='capacity'` specifies that the edge attribute 'capacity' should be used as the flow capacity for each edge.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of buses that can be transported per hour from Node 302 to Node 714.\n\nThe function call to execute this method is:\n```python\nmethod(data)\n``` \n\nThis call will return the numerical value of the maximum flow, which is the solution to the problem."

The result is the maximum possible flow from the source to the sink, considering all edge capacities.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the numerical value of the maximum flow, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, providing an optimal solution with minimal code."

This is a classic maximum flow problem, where the network is represented as an undirected graph with capacities on the edges. The solution involves computing the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) using an appropriate algorithm.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem reduces to finding the maximum flow in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge can be considered as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity. The maximum flow from the source (302) to the sink (714) will give the maximum number of e-bikes that can be dispatched per hour, assuming the capacities are the limiting factors.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph, which internally uses an efficient algorithm.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - The input `data` is assumed to be a NetworkX graph where edges have a 'capacity' attribute.\n   - Use the `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    return nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714, capacity='capacity')\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function `method(data)`**: This function takes a NetworkX graph `data` as input. The graph should have edges with a 'capacity' attribute indicating the maximum flow each edge can handle. The function computes the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink) using NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function, which returns the value of the maximum flow.\n- **Function Call**: The line `method(data)` calls the function with the provided graph data, returning the maximum number of e-bikes that can be dispatched per hour from station 302 to core area 714, considering the network's capacity constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging NetworkX's built-in functions, ensuring accuracy and performance."

This is essentially a maximum flow problem, where we want to find the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714 in the undirected graph, considering the segment capacities as the capacities of the edges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem as a Maximum Flow Problem**: The problem can be modeled using the concept of maximum flow in a flow network. The nodes represent the stations, and the edges represent the roads between them with capacities indicating the maximum number of e-bikes that can traverse the road per hour.\n2. **Use NetworkX to Compute Maximum Flow**: NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow` which can compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. For an undirected graph, each edge is treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.\n3. **Return the Maximum Flow Value**: The result from the `maximum_flow` function will give the maximum number of e-bikes that can be sent from node 302 to node 714 per hour.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = data\n    max_flow_value, _ = nx.maximum_flow(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Import NetworkX**: The `networkx` library is used to handle graph operations.\n2. **Function Definition**: The function `method` takes the graph `data` as input.\n3. **Compute Maximum Flow**: The `nx.maximum_flow` function is called with the graph, source node (302), and target node (714). This function returns the maximum flow value and a flow dictionary. We only need the maximum flow value, which is stored in `max_flow_value`.\n4. **Return Result**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of e-bikes that can be dispatched per hour from node 302 to node 714.\n5. **Function Call**: The function is called with the graph data, and it returns the numerical result directly.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the maximum flow algorithm to solve the problem, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of shared cars that can simultaneously travel from the dispatch hub (region 302) to the charging station (region 714) in the given traffic network. This is a classic maximum flow problem, where the network is represented as an undirected graph, and we need to compute the maximum flow from the source node (302) to the sink node (714).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding the maximum flow in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge can carry flow in both directions, but the total flow in both directions combined cannot exceed the edge's capacity. However, NetworkX's maximum flow functions typically work with directed graphs. Therefore, we need to model each undirected edge as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow` which uses an efficient implementation of these algorithms.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - The input is an undirected graph `data` in NetworkX format.\n   - The function will compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink).\n   - The result will be the value of the maximum flow, which represents the maximum number of cars that can be dispatched per hour under the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # The graph is undirected, but max flow requires directed edges. \n    # NetworkX's maximum_flow function can handle converting undirected to directed internally.\n    flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `method(data)`**:\n   - This function takes an undirected graph `data` as input.\n   - It uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). The function internally handles the conversion of undirected edges into two directed edges for the flow calculation.\n   - The result, `flow_value`, is the maximum number of cars that can be dispatched per hour from region 302 to region 714, which is returned by the function.\n\n2. **Function Call**:\n   - The line `method(data)` calls the function with the given graph data, and the return value is the maximum flow between the specified nodes.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging NetworkX's built-in algorithms for maximum flow calculations, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."

The maximum flow represents the maximum number of cars that can be dispatched per hour without causing congestion, assuming each edge in the graph has a certain capacity (which we assume to be 1 if not specified, but the problem implies capacities are part of the graph data).\n\n2. **NetworkX for Maximum Flow**: NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. For an undirected graph, each edge is treated as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.\n\n3. **Implement the Function**: The function will take the graph data, use the `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX to compute the maximum flow between node 302 and node 714, and return this value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = nx.Graph(data)\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Construction**: The function starts by constructing an undirected graph `G` from the provided `data` which is assumed to be in a format compatible with NetworkX (e.g., a dictionary of edges or another graph structure).\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function is used to compute the maximum flow between node 302 (source) and node 714 (sink). This function efficiently calculates the flow using an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Edmonds-Karp or Dinic's algorithm).\n3. **Return Value**: The computed maximum flow value is returned, which represents the maximum number of cars that can be dispatched per hour between the two nodes without congestion.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, providing an optimal solution for the given network."

    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the maximum number of cars that can be simultaneously dispatched per hour between the service center node 302 and peak station 714 in an undirected road network under congestion-free conditions. This is essentially a problem of finding the maximum flow between two nodes in an undirected graph, where the edges represent roads with certain capacities (likely representing the number of cars that can traverse the road per hour).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714 in an undirected graph. In graph theory, the maximum flow between two nodes is the maximum amount of flow (in this case, cars) that can be sent from the source node (302) to the sink node (714) without exceeding the capacity of any edge, and respecting flow conservation at all nodes except the source and sink.\n\n2. **Undirected Graph Handling**: In an undirected graph, each edge can carry flow in both directions. However, the total flow in both directions combined cannot exceed the edge's capacity. To handle this in NetworkX, we can represent each undirected edge as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or its variants (like Edmonds-Karp) are commonly used to solve maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes using an efficient algorithm.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    # Assuming data is a dictionary or some structure that can be converted to a graph\n    # For example, data might be a list of edges with capacities or a NetworkX graph\n    # Here, we assume data is a NetworkX graph already\n    if isinstance(data, nx.Graph):\n        G = data\n    else:\n        # Handle other cases if necessary, but the problem states it's in NetworkX format\n        pass\n    max_flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714, capacity='capacity')\n    return max_flow_value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Handling**: The function starts by checking if the input `data` is already a NetworkX graph. If it is, it uses this graph directly. Otherwise, it might need to process the data into a graph format, but the problem states that the graph is already in NetworkX format, so this step is more of a safeguard.\n\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function then uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow between node 302 (source) and node 714 (sink). The `capacity` parameter is set to 'capacity', assuming that the edges in the graph have an attribute named 'capacity' which indicates the maximum flow each edge can handle. If the edges use a different attribute name for capacity, this parameter should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the maximum number of cars that can be dispatched per hour from node 302 to node 714 without causing congestion.\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\nThis line calls the function `method` with the provided `data` (the NetworkX graph) and returns the maximum flow value between nodes 302 and 714. The result is a single numerical value representing the maximum number of cars that can be dispatched per hour under congestion-free conditions."

This is a classic maximum flow problem, which can be efficiently solved using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or any other algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem reduces to finding the maximum flow from the starting node (302) to the destination node (714) in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, each edge can be treated as two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity. The maximum flow from the source to the sink will give the maximum number of cars that can be dispatched per hour, assuming each edge has a capacity of 1 (or any specified capacity, but the problem states the capacity is the same for all edges).\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for this problem. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph, which internally uses an efficient algorithm.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - The input `data` is assumed to be a NetworkX graph.\n   - Use the `maximum_flow_value` function from NetworkX to compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714.\n   - Return the computed maximum flow value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    return nx.maximum_flow_value(data, 302, 714)\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function `method(data)`**: This function takes a NetworkX graph `data` as input. The graph represents the road network where nodes are intersections and edges are roads with bidirectional traffic capacity.\n- **NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value`**: This function computes the maximum flow between the source node (302) and the sink node (714). The result is the maximum number of cars that can be dispatched per hour, which is equivalent to the maximum flow in the network.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum flow value directly, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, providing an optimal solution with minimal code."

The maximum flow from the source to the sink will give the maximum number of shared cars that can be dispatched per hour without exceeding the road capacities.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which computes the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. This function uses an efficient algorithm (like Edmonds-Karp) to solve the problem.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - The input graph `data` is assumed to be an undirected graph in NetworkX format. However, for flow problems, we typically need to handle directed edges. If the graph is undirected, each undirected edge can be represented as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity.\n   - The function will compute the maximum flow from node 302 to node 714 and return the flow value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # The graph is undirected, but for max flow, we can treat each edge as two directed edges with the same capacity\n    # Check if the graph is directed; if not, convert it to a directed graph with bidirectional edges\n    if not data.is_directed():\n        directed_graph = data.to_directed()\n    else:\n        directed_graph = data\n    # Compute the maximum flow from 302 to 714\n    flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(directed_graph, 302, 714)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Handling**: The function first checks if the input graph is directed. If it is undirected, it converts the graph into a directed graph with each undirected edge represented as two directed edges (both directions) with the same capacity. This is necessary because flow algorithms typically work on directed graphs.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The function then uses NetworkX's `maximum_flow_value` function to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). This function efficiently calculates the maximum possible flow between the two nodes while respecting the capacity constraints of the edges.\n3. **Return Value**: The result of the maximum flow calculation is returned, which represents the maximum number of shared cars that can be dispatched per hour from station 302 to hub station 714 without exceeding the road capacities.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem using standard graph algorithms provided by NetworkX, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."

The maximum flow will give us the theoretical maximum transport capacity, i.e., the number of vehicles that can be dispatched per hour.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem is essentially a maximum flow problem in an undirected graph. The goal is to find the maximum number of vehicles that can be sent from node 302 to node 714 per hour, given the capacities of the roads (edges) between nodes.\n2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is undirected, meaning each edge can carry flow in both directions. However, the total flow in both directions combined cannot exceed the edge's capacity.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (or its variants like Edmonds-Karp) is suitable for solving maximum flow problems. NetworkX provides a function `maximum_flow_value` which can compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph.\n4. **Implementation**: Convert the undirected graph into a directed graph by replacing each undirected edge with two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same capacity. Then, use the maximum flow algorithm to compute the flow from the source (302) to the sink (714).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef method(data):\n    # The graph is undirected, but for max flow, we can treat it as directed with bidirectional edges\n    G = nx.Graph(data)\n    # Compute the maximum flow between node 302 and node 714\n    flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G, 302, 714)\n    return flow_value\n```\n\n### Function Call\n```python\nmethod(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Handling**: The function takes the input graph `data` (assumed to be in NetworkX format) and constructs an undirected graph `G`.\n2. **Maximum Flow Calculation**: The `nx.maximum_flow_value` function is used to compute the maximum flow from node 302 (source) to node 714 (sink). This function internally handles the conversion of undirected edges into bidirectional directed edges with the same capacity.\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed maximum flow value, which represents the theoretical maximum number of vehicles that can be dispatched per hour from node 302 to node 714.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NetworkX's built-in functions to solve the maximum flow problem, providing the desired transport capacity with minimal code."
