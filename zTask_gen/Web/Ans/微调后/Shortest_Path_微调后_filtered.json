        "question": "According to certain network attack logs, hackers attempted to laterally penetrate from the vulnerable entry node '0302' to the core data node '0714'. Assuming the attacker can only move unidirectionally through web hyperlinks, please calculate the shortest penetration path length between the two nodes to assess which critical path the system needs to prioritize for strengthening.",
