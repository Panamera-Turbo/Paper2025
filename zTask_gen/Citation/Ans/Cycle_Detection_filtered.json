The goal is to detect the presence of cycles, with the result returned as a boolean value. We should avoid directly mentioning algorithm names, like cycle detection, and express it in business terminology.\n\nGiven the optimization of the literature retrieval system, it may involve preventing erroneous citations or circular references. For example, the system needs to ensure that citation relationships between documents are reasonable and that there are no circular references causing information conflicts. This makes the question more natural.\n\nNext, based on the constraints, the question should be concise, around 100 words, phrased as a question, and not involve specific nodes. For example, a suitable question could be: \"When updating citation data, does the system need to check whether the current network has circular references to avoid academic misconduct?\" This aligns well with the business scenario while implicitly requesting cycle detection.\n\nFinally, let’s check if it meets all constraints: it does not mention the algorithm name, uses \"current network\" as a substitute, revolves around the existence of circular structures, and is related to system optimization.",
